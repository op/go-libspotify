## Golang libspotify bindings

Package spotify adds language bindings for libspotify in Go. The libspotify C
API package allows third-party developers to write applications that utilize
the Spotify music streaming service.

This is a work in progress. Expect this API to change. Patches are welcome.

## Installing

    $ go get github.com/op/go-libspotify

After this command *go-libspotify* is ready to use. Its source will be in:

    $GOPATH/src/pkg/github.com/op/go-libspotify

You can use `go get -u -a` to update all installed packages.
